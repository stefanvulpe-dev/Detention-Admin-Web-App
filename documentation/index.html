      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        DeAd (Detention Admin) is a web application designed to manage the visits
         available to a person who is incarcerated in a prison. It aims to streamline
          the process of visitation by providing a reliable and efficient system for 
          recording essential information related to each visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app will record information regarding the individual or individuals making the visit, 
        including their identity, photo, relationship with the convict (relative, legal guardian, 
        lawyer, friend), and the nature of the visit. It will also record the date of the meeting, 
        its nature and duration (e.g., consultation regarding the appeal of the trial, friendly visit), 
        possible objects/data provided to the convict, and other relevant information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary objective of DeAd is to provide an accurate and secure record of all visits made 
        by individuals to a prison. The app will be useful for prison staff, inmates, and visitors, 
        allowing them to easily manage and access visitation information. It will provide a streamlined 
        process for booking visits, making changes to existing bookings, and canceling visits, minimizing 
        the potential for errors or confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this documentation, we will provide a detailed overview of the features and functionalities 
        of the DeAd web application. We will also outline the system requirements, installation procedures, 
        and user instructions to ensure that users can easily set up and use the app. We will also cover 
        the security measures in place to protect sensitive information, ensuring the privacy and 
        confidentiality of all parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, DeAd will provide a comprehensive and user-friendly system for managing prison visits, 
        enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the visitation process for all stakeholders.

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The Detention Admin application is composed of seven web pages so that it follows certain 
        methodologies for the structure of web applications. With a logical and well-designed 
        architecture, the application offers clear and easy-to-use facilities for any user. 
        In the following lines, the architecture of each page that makes up Detention Admin will be detailed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application pages share the same header and footer structured as follows:
      </p>
      <section class="Root">
        <h3>The header</h3>
        <p>
          The application header is composed of two areas. The website logo is present on the 
          left side. On the right side is the navigation bar that allows you to go to one of 
          the home, about, statistics and contact pages.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="Root">
        <h3>The footer</h3>
        <p>          
         The footer of the application is divided into three areas. The first is the copyright 
         area and in the second part there are links to the social media pages associated with 
         the site. And besides these, the back to top button is also available.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Root">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>The <code>index.html</code> page</h3>
        <p>
            The main page of the application is divided into two areas, the hero section and 
            the main area. The main element of the hero section is the button to schedule 
            a visit. By scrolling, you reach the main area, which contains various articles 
            and news that could be of interest to website visitors.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Root">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>The <code>login.html</code> page</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to schedule a visit, a user will have to connect to an account in our database. 
          Thus, we arrive at the "Login" page where we will be greeted by a bordered box in which 
          there are 2 fields. If the user has an account, then he will enter his email address and 
          password, pressing the "Log in" button on the right. If the user does not have an account, 
          then he must enter a valid and unused email address and a password. Finally, he will press 
          the "Sign up" button on the left to complete the form.

        <p>            
         The page for registering the details of each visitor of the same inmate 
         provides users with two areas of action. The first is the modification 
         area of ​​the visitors list. Here you can add a new visitor and delete all 
         visitors. In the second area we find the list of visitors and their information, 
         being able to delete a visitor or edit the information about him.

          section from the page header. When this page opens, the user will be 
          greeted with information about the penitentiary grouped by years, each 
          with a picture associated to increase the suggestiveness.

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      <p>
        The main actors interacting with the web application will be the users and the prison administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user you will be able to do the following actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The user will be able to schedule a visit, but this action will require logging into an existing 
          account. After logging in, the user will have to enter his own personal data as well as those of 
          those accompanying him (max. 5). After this step has also taken place, the last step is filling 
          in the information regarding the visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another action a user can take is to view prison statistics on the related web page, 
          available from the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          A user will also be able to view the page dedicated to general information about the prison.
        </li>
        <li>
          A last action available to a user actor is to provide feedback or request information available 
          on the contact page.
        </li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          The second main actor is represented by the prison administrator. The following actions are available:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All the actions of a user actor are also actions of an administrator actor, with the exception of 
            the action of scheduling a visit and that of interacting with the contact page.
          </li>
          <li>
            An additional action for the user actor is the option to download reports related to the visits 
            made per individual, the time period, depending on the category of the punishment committed or 
            other criteria.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A secondary actor that interacts with the website is the web server. Its actions are vital 
          for the smooth functioning of the entire application. The server actions are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The web server is responsible for verifying all data related to form inputs, username and password.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any information is provided incorrectly or raises an error signal, the server will provide 
            an error message to notify the actors interacting with the website.
          </li>
          <li>            
            The web server will notify each user actor by email after the visit scheduling action has 
            been successfully carried out
          </li>
          <li>            
            Another action performed by the server is the synchronization of the statistics information 
            with the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            The web server will generate the reports requested by an administrator actor and make 
            them available for download in the desired format.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        For this project we used the following important technologies: HTML, BEM and Sass.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was the most important part because it 
            offered us a way to put elements on the page such as titles, paragraphs, images, etc. 
            Also, a rigorous HTML structure was kept, which includes the 3 important tags, <code>html</code>, 
            <code>body</code> and <code>head</code>. Also, for more strictness and understanding, we used semantic tags 
            such as <code>main</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>nav</code> and more.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Second, we used the BEM (Block Element Modifier) ​​methodology because it gave us a way 
            to uniquely name element classes. Thus, we managed throughout the project not to enter 
            into conflicts generated by CSS names. Also, by having all these concise names, we 
            managed to create a tighter connection between the HTML and CSS code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Third, we used Sass, which is a tool that helped us generate CSS code in an efficient way. 
            Thus, we were able to organize ourselves better,to not  repeat CSS code and to use specific 
            functionalities such as mixin functions, variables and many others.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

# DeAd

DeAd (Detention Admin) is a web app supposed to manage the visits available to a person who is inside a prison.

## Description

Each visit will be accompanied by information regarding the individual or individuals making the visit - minimally, the following will be considered: identity, photo, relationship with the convict (relative, legal guardian, lawyer, friend), nature of the visit.

It will also be recorded: the date of the meeting, its nature and duration (e.g., consultation regarding the appeal of the trial, friendly visit), possible objects/data provided to the convict, etc.
